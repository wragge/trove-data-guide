    "The Trove Data Guide aims to help researchers understand, access, and use data from Trove. But just because it's about 'data' doesn't mean you need to be able to code. To understand Trove data and its possibilities for research, you first need to understand Trove itself â€“ its history, its structure, its assumptions, and its limits. This knowledge is useful to any Trove user.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, all Trove users would benefit from knowing more about [works and versions](trove-is/works-and-versions), or how to use the ['simple' search box for complex queries](understanding-search/simple-search-options). There's also an introduction to [what's in (and not in) the digitised newspapers](newspapers-and-gazettes/newspaper-corpus), and similar overviews for other digitised content such as [books](other-digitised-resources/books/overview), [parliamentary papers](other-digitised-resources/parliamentary-papers/overview), and [oral histories](other-digitised-resources/parliamentary-papers/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "For people who are more comfortable with code there are plenty of useful snippets and complete working examples. For example there are sections that document how to [get metadata, text, and images from newspapers](newspapers-and-gazettes/data/accessing-data), and [other digitised resources](other-digitised-resources/accessing-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trove Data Guide also fills many gaps in the official Trove documentation, so check here if you run into problems, or can't figure out how to achieve a particular task. There are a series of 'HOW TO' pages that document more complex data access methods, while the [Pathways](other-digitised-resources/accessing-data) section provides detailed tutorials that lead you step by step through examples of packaging Trove data for use with other digital tools.\n"
