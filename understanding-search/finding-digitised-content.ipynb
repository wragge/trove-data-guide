This could happen if there were multiple versions of a single work, including one that has been digitised, and another that has been submitted via the National E-Deposit service. In this case, setting `NOT nuc:\"ANL:NED\"` would exclude the work and *all* its versions from your results. \n",

For example, if an item has been digitised and published online, the `identifiers` field in the metadata should include a url containing 'nla.obj' with the `linktype` of `fulltext`. <mark>==Link to accessing data section for more?==</mark>"

Many of these will be in PDF format. It's not a reliable way of finding digitised items with downloadable text.\n",

But there are many digitised resources that either contain no text at all, or have no text that can be extracted by OCR. Adding `imageInd:thumbnail` to your search can help find these items. However, like `fullTextInd` this index is applied to aggregated collections as well as digitised resources, so your results can include all sorts of content, from book covers to pictures of politicians. There's also no guarantee that an item with a thumbnail will provide a larger image for download."
