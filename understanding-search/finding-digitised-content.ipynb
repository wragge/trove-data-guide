This could happen if there were multiple versions of a single work, including one that has been digitised, and another that has been submitted via the National E-Deposit service.

For example, if an item has been digitised and published online, the `identifiers` field in the metadata should include a url containing 'nla.obj' with the `linktype` of `fulltext`. <mark>==Link to accessing data section for more?==</mark>"

However, like `fullTextInd` this index is applied to aggregated collections as well as digitised resources, so your results can include all sorts of content, from book covers to pictures of politicians.
