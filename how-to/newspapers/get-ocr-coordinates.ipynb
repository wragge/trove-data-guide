    "The OCR process not only extracts text from an image, it generates coordinates that document the position of each piece of text within the parent image. You could use this information to crop an image of the OCRd text out of the parent image. In the case of digitised newspapers, this sort of positional information could help you explore the layout and contents of newspaper pages and how this changes over time.\n",

    "- `data-y`: vertical offset of the top left corner of a box surrounding the line (in pixels)\n",
