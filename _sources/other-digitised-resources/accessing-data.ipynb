    "\n",
    "To download the complete OCRd text of a single publication you need to know the number of pages in the publication. This can be found by [extracting the metadata](/other-digitised-resources/how-to/extract-embedded-metadata) embedded in the digitised book and journal viewer and [getting the length of the `page` list](digitised:howto:embedded:pages).\n",

For example, [this issue](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-326379450) of *Pacific Islands Monthly* contains 164 pages, so the url to download the complete OCRd text would be:\n",

    "You can use the same url pattern to download OCRd text from any range of pages. For example, to download text from the first five pages of a publication, you'd set `firstPage` to `0` and `lastPage` to `4`. To download text from page two, you'd set both `firstPage` and `lastPage` to `1`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The OCR data is quite complex. It contains information about the position of *every word* on the page. To extract just the text you have to find all the text blocks, then loop through each line and word, stitching them back together as a plain text document. If all you want is the text, the method described above is probably more efficient, but if you're interested in the layout as well as the content of a page, this methods opens up some new possibilities."
