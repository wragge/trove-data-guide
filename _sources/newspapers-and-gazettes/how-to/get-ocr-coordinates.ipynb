    "The OCR process not only extracts text from an image, it generates coordinates that document the position of each piece of text within the parent image. You could use this information to crop an image of the OCRd text out of the parent image. In the case of digitised newspapers, this sort of positional information could help you explore the layout and contents of newspaper pages and how this changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "No positional information is available from the Trove API, however, there is some embedded within the web site. If you view the source of a newspaper article's web page, you'll find a number of `<input>` tags like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `value` attribute of the tag includes the text of a single line. The `data` attributes provide the positional coordinates of that line:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data-x`: horizontal offset of the top left corner of a box surrounding the line (in pixels)\n",
    "- `data-y`: vertical offset of the top left corner of a box surrounding the line (in pixels)\n",
    "- `data-w`: the width of a box surrounding the line (in pixels)\n",
    "- `data-h`: the height of a box surrounding the line (in pixels)\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual lines are aggregated into blocks of content labelled as `zones` within the HTML. The position of each zone is also recorded:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"zone onPage readMode\" data-page-id=\"5417618\" data-x=\"2889\" data-y=\"487\" data-w=\"862\" data-h=\"89\" data-rotation=\"-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The pixel values are absolute, so they relate to a page image at a specific resolution. This resolution is the highest available from the Trove web interface, with a zoom level of `7`. See below for [information on saving page images](download-a-page-image).\n",

    "\n",
    "With an extra little trick you can even get the coordinates of an individual word. This information is not ordinarily contained within the HTML, *but* if you search for a particular word, that word is wrapped in a `<span>` tag that applies highlighting and includes the page coordinates. Here's a line of text with a highlighted word:\n",

    "\n",
    "In theory, you could write some code that gets the positions of every word in an article by looping through the words, adding each one to the page url's `searchTerm` parameter so that it's highlighted, then grabbing the coordinates from the `<span>`. It would be rather inefficient though.\n",
