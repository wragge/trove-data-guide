- the copyright cliff of death

Sources of data include:

- [Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard](https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-totals/) and the [weekly harvests](https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals) on which it is based
- [trove-newspaper-totals-historical](https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals-historical) (assorted harvests from 2011 to 2022)
- [Gathering historical data about the addition of newspaper titles to Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/historical-data-newspaper-titles/) â€“ info on when titles were added to Trove scraped from web archives, see related datasets
