    "Date searches can produce odd results when you're working with aggregated content (as in the *Books & Libraries* category). What do you think happens if you set the `l-decade` facet to `200` (ie 2000 to 2009) and the `l-year` facet to `1900`? In the *Newspapers & Gazettes* category you get no results, as you would expect. But in *Books & Libraries* you get more than a million results!\n",

    "\n",
    "How is this possible? How can both facet values be true? The answer lies in the way [versions of publications are grouped together as works](/what-is-trove/works-and-versions). If there are multiple versions of a work with different publication dates, the date of the work in Trove will be a range encompassing all the version dates. For example, a work that has versions published in `1900` and `2022` will have an `issued` value of `1900-2022`. Because Trove searches for works rather than versions, a search for any date within the `issued` date range will return the work. So the same work can be published between 2000 and 2009, and also in 1900.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you want to find a version published on a specific date? The Trove web interface has an option to filter a work's 'editions' (aka versions) by date. If you're using the API, you'll first have to requests details of all versions by setting the `include` parameter to `workversions`. Then you'll need to loop through all the versions, checking their individual `issued` dates.\n",
