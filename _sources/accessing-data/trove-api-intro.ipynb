    "\n",
    "For a more structured approach to building an API request you can try [Trove's API v3 interface](https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/index.html), though it can be a bit intimidating for new users.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",

    "\n",
    "API **requests** are just normal urls. They encode your questions using query parameters. For example, the Trove API uses the `q` parameter for search terms, so including `q=wragge` in your API request will ask Trove to search for resources that include the word 'wragge'.\n",

    "- search results – a list of results matching a supplied search query\n",

    "- lists of records – a list of system-controlled values, such as newspaper titles or Trove contributors\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of data has its own address, or **endpoint**, that you need to include in the request url so that your parameters get sent to the right place. The addresses all share the same base url (the `v3` at the end is the current version of the Trove API):\n",

    "https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3\n",

    "```\n",
    "https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You separate the endpoint from your query using a `?`, so to search for articles including the word 'wragge' in the `newspaper` category you'd use a url like this (click the link to view the results):\n",
