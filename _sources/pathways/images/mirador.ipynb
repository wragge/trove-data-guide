    "\n",
    "Like other digitised content in Trove, manuscript finding aids can be difficult to find. To help you explore the possibilities, [here's a database](https://glam-workbench.net/datasette-lite/?csv=https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/nla-finding-aids-data/blob/main/finding-aids-totals.csv#/data/finding-aids-totals) containing details of more than 2,000 digitised finding aids available through Trove.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding collection pages\n",
    "\n",
    "Trove groups digitised resources into collections of different shapes and sizes. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [a finding aid describing the papers of Sir Edmund Barton](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-224441684)\n",
    "- [an album of photographs from the B.A.N.Z. Antarctic Research Expedition](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-141170265)\n",
    "- [a collection of postcards featuring actresses and Australian towns](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-140670968)\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections can contain a variety of formats including photographs, posters, art works, ephemera, letters, and manuscripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding collections in Trove can be tricky because there's no way of filtering search results to only show collections. This means your search results might include collections, as well as individual items from those collections. See [](../../understanding-search/finding-digitised-content) for help with finding digitised resources. Search results will include a **View** link that takes you to Trove's digital resource viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most collections have a landing page with a big green button that says 'Browse this collection'. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../../images/collection-album-landing.png\n",
    ":width: 600px\n",
    ":name: collection-album-landing\n",
    "\n",
    "The landing page for the B.A.N.Z. Antarctic Research Expedition photographs (https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-141170265)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your search results lead to an item within a collection, rather than a landing page, you can usually navigate up the collection hierarchy by using the breadcrumb links.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../../images/collection-breadcrumbs.png\n",
    ":width: 600px\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigation within collections can be confusing, and it can sometimes be hard to tell what level of the collection hierarchy you're actually on. Because of this it might take a bit of trial and error to get to the page you need to harvest the collection data you're actually interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Series and sub-collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Manuscript collections are often arranged hierarchically, with individual items grouped into series and sub-series. Trove displays these hierarchies in the form of 'finding aids' that present a one page overview of the complete collection. But under the hood, the levels within these hierarchies are actually created using Trove's digitised collection viewer. This means we can selectively harvest *parts* of manuscript collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's part of the finding aid for the [Papers of Alfred Deakin](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-225220821/findingaid), displaying 'Series 11. Federation delegate, 1884-1944'.\n",

    "## Saving a Trove collection as an IIIF manifest\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in importing Trove data into Mirador is to save the data in a format that Mirador understands. You can save a Trove collection as an IIIF manifest using [this noteboook](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/save-image-collection-iiif/) in the GLAM Workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is IIIF?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/), more conveniently known as IIIF, develops open standards for sharing digital objects, such as images. IIIF platforms and standards are used by GLAM organisations around the world to deliver their image collections online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have standards for sharing image metadata, people can build tools that work across collections. For example, [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/) and [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) are both richly featured, open source, community developed image viewing platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "IIIF manifests are JSON files that describe a set of digital objects. They include technical information about the images and how to access them, as well as metadata describing their content and context. Everything you need to explore the images is packaged up in a single, standards based file. This means that if you point a manifest at tools like Universal Viewer and Mirador, they can present the images to users without any special configuration. Similarly, Tropy knows what to expect when you import data from an IIIF manifest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately Trove doesnâ€™t provide data using IIIF standards. Indeed, it doesnâ€™t really supply any machine-readable data about the contents of digital collections. The GLAM Workbench notebook scrapes metadata from Troveâ€™s digital collection viewer, reassembling it as a standard IIIF manifest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to [Save a collection of digitised images as an IIIF manifest](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/save-image-collection-iiif/) in the Trove images section of the GLAM Workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook, like all GLAM Workbench notebooks, needs to be run in a customised computing environment. The easiest way to do this is through BinderHub. BinderHub is a cloud-based service that gets a notebook up and running by reading its requirements from a code repository, and creating an environment with the necessary software. The GLAM Workbench is integrated with two BinderHub services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ARDC Binder](https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/ardc-binderhub-service/) â€“ based in Australia, requires login using university credentials\n",

    "If you have a login at an Australian university or research agency, try the ARDC Binder service first. It's a little more effort, but it's usually faster and more reliable than the public MyBinder service which can have capacity issues.\n",
