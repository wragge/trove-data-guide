    "\n",
    "The first thing you need is a collection to harvest! More specifically, you need to find a collection's landing page in Trove's digitised collection viewer. Once you've found the collection page, you can copy its `nla.obj` identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding collection pages\n",
    "\n",
    "<-- see also link to GW list of finding aids? -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Trove groups digitised resources into collections of different shapes and sizes. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [a finding aid describing the papers of Sir Edmund Barton](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-224441684)\n",
    "- [an album of photographs from the B.A.N.Z. Antarctic Research Expedition](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-141170265)\n",
    "- [a collection of postcards featuring actresses and Australian towns](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-140670968)\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections can contain a variety of formats including photographs, posters, art works, ephemera, letters, and manuscripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding collections in Trove can be tricky because there's no way of filtering search results to only show collections. This means your search results might include collections, as well as individual items from those collections. See [](../../understanding-search/finding-digitised-content) for help with finding digitised resources. Search results will include a **View** link that takes you to Trove's digital resource viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most collections have a landing page with a big green button that says 'Browse this collection'. \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your search results lead to an item within a collection, rather than a landing page, you can usually navigate up the collection hierarchy by using the breadcrumb links.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections can also include other collections. For example, the Barton Papers are divided into series, and each series has its own landing page. Here's the landing page for [Series 6, Papers relating to the Federation Campaign](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-224441858). However, the finding aid only links to items within a series, not to the series landing page itself. To get to the series page from the finding aid, you need to go down the hierarchy to an item in the series, then back up the breadcrumbs trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigation within collections can be confusing, and it can sometimes be hard to tell what level of the collection hierarchy you're actually on. Because of this it might take a bit of trial and error to get to the page you need to harvest the collection data you're actually interested in.\n",

    "## Saving a Trove collection as an IIIF manifest\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in importing Trove data into Tropy is to save the data in a format that Tropy understands. Tropy has plugins that enable it to import data from CSV files and IIIF manifests. You can save a Trove collection as an IIIF manifest using [this noteboook](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/save-image-collection-iiif/) in the GLAM Workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is IIIF?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/), more conveniently known as IIIF, develops open standards for sharing digital objects, such as images. IIIF platforms and standards are used by GLAM organisations around the world to deliver their image collections online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have standards for sharing image metadata, people can build tools that work across collections. For example, [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/) and [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) are both richly featured, open source, community developed image viewing platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "IIIF manifests are JSON files that describe a set of digital objects. They include technical information about the images and how to access them, as well as metadata describing their content and context. Everything you need to explore the images is packaged up in a single, standards based file. This means that if you point a manifest at tools like Universal Viewer and Mirador, they can present the images to users without any special configuration. Similarly, Tropy knows what to expect when you import data from an IIIF manifest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately Trove doesn’t provide data using IIIF standards. Indeed, it doesn’t really supply any machine-readable data about the contents of digital collections. The GLAM Workbench notebook scrapes metadata from Trove’s digital collection viewer, reassembling it as a standard IIIF manifest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to [Save a collection of digitised images as an IIIF manifest](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/save-image-collection-iiif/) in the Trove images section of the GLAM Workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook, like all GLAM Workbench notebooks, needs to be run in a customised computing environment. The easiest way to do this is through BinderHub. BinderHub is a cloud-based service that gets a notebook up and running by reading its requirements from a code repository, and creating the necessary environment. The GLAM Workbench is integrated with two BinderHub services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ARDC Binder](https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/ardc-binderhub-service/) – based in Australia, requires login using university credentials\n",
    "- [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) – international, no login required\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a login at an Australian university or research agency, try the ARDC Binder service first. It's a little more effort, but it's usually faster and more reliable than the public MyBinder service which can have capacity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GLAM Workbench displays a preview of the notebook, with options to run it using either the ARDC Binder of MyBinder service.\n",

    "#### Using ARDC Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the ARDC Binder service, click on the ARDC Binder tab under the notebook preview. You should see a big, blue **Run live on ARDC Binder** button. Click on the button to launch the Binder service.\n",

    "## Organising Trove collections in Tropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Tropy provides a number of mechanisms for organising the contents of your imported collections, so your research is no longer bound by Trove's descriptive framework. One thing to note, however, is that the whole IIIF manifest is imported into Tropy as a single 'Item', with individual images grouped as 'Photos' within that item. This limits your options for re-organising images. Fortunately, there's a quick solution. Right click on the manifest 'Item' and choose 'Explode' from the menu.\n",

    ":name: tropy-explode\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose 'Explode' from the item menu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "'Explode' will split the manifest, creating a new item for each image. You're then free to group the items as your project requires. Consult the [Tropy documentation](https://docs.tropy.org/) to find out about creating your own structures with lists and tags. There's also a 'Combine' option that works like 'Explode' in reverse, grouping individual images together as a single item.\n",

    "- the [Archive plugin](https://github.com/tropy/tropy-plugin-archive) lets you export all your metadata and images as a single zip file\n",
