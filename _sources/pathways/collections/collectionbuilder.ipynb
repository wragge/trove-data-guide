You can create a list to organise your research on a particular topic, adding relevant newspaper and gazette articles, as well as work records from other Trove categories. See the Trove help documentation for [information on creating and using lists](https://trove.nla.gov.au/help/become-voluntrove/lists).\n",

    "\n",
    "You can annotate items in your Trove lists by adding notes. You can do this when you first add an item to a list by filling in the 'Reason for adding this item' field. Or you can add notes later by clicking on the **Add list item note** button from the list interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "One undocumented feature of these notes is that they support basic HTML tags like `<p></p>` (for paragraphs), `<b></b>` (for **bold**), and `<i></i>` for italics. Links, however, will be removed. This means you can apply some simple formatting to your notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes will be saved in the `description` field of your CollectionBuilder metadata, and displayed (with any HTML formatting) on the item's page in the final exhibition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any tags attached to items will be added to the `subject` field in the CollectionBuilder metadata and used to create a word cloud visualisation in the exhibition interface.

    "\n",
    "### Make sure your list is set to **public**\n",
    "\n",

    "To download data from your list using the [Convert a Trove list into a CollectionBuilder exhibition](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/convert-list-to-cb-exhibition/) notebook, you need the list's numeric identifier. The identifier is the number in the url of your Trove list. For example, if your list has the url `https://trove.nla.gov.au/list/83774` then the identifier is `83774`.

    "The [Convert a Trove list into a CollectionBuilder exhibition](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/convert-list-to-cb-exhibition/) notebook does what it can to get useful metadata out of Trove, but sometime the information's just not there. For example, there may be images or articles relating to a particular place that don't have any spatial metadata. You can add this sort of information to your exhibition by manually editing the metadata CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about places is contained in three columns: `location`, `latitude`, and `longitude`. In the location field you can include a list of place names, separated by semicolons, eg: 'Melbourne; Sydney; Hobart'. These placenames will be used to build a word cloud when you click on the 'Location' tab in your exhibition. To add an item to CollectionBuilder's map view, you need to supply values for `latitude` and `longitude`. You might also want to edit the subject, and description fields.\n",

    "\n",
    "The CollectionBuilder site describes the GitHub Pages template as 'great option for learning, teaching, quick prototyping, or just testing'. But if you want to develop your exhibition further, it suggests using the [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/csv/) approach, which is more 'robust, flexible, and customizable'. There's a detailed tutorial describing how you can [convert your exhibition from Pages to CSV](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/transfer-walkthrough/). The CSV approach goes beyond the limitations of GitHub Pages and enhances the display of your items, but it's more technically advanced and requires the installation of software on your local computer."
