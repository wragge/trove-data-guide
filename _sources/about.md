# About this Guide

The Trove Data Guide is being developed by [Tim Sherratt](https://timsherratt.org) as part of the [ARDC Community Data Lab](https://ardc.edu.au/project/ardc-community-data-lab/).

The published version is available at: <https://tdg.glam-workbench.net>.

The Trove Data Guide received investment from the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/">Australian Research Data Commons</a> (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).

## GLAM Workbench

The Trove Data Guide is a companion to the Trove sections of the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/). While the GLAM Workbench provides tools and examples for working with data from Trove, this Guide digs deeper into the complexities to help researchers develop a critical understanding of Trove data – its limits and its possibilities.

## Development and feedback

More content will be added to the Trove Data Guide over coming months. To view work-in-progress see the [development version](https://wragge.github.io/trove-data-guide/) and the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wragge/trove-data-guide).

Ideas, corrections, and new content are very welcome – find out more about [contributing to the Trove Data Guide](contributing.md).
