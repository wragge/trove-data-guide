(what-are-newspaper-pages)=
## What are pages?

Printed newspaper pages are easy to understand. You can read them, you can turn them, you can wrap your fish and chips in them. Digitised newspaper pages in Trove are a bit more complex and exist in several related forms.

### Pages are metadata

In printed newspapers, pages are the main means of navigation. But in Trove, users search for articles, and have to browse up along the breadcrumbs trail to find the current page. Every digitised article has a metadata field that records the number of the page on which the article was published. That number is displayed in the web interface and included in article records delivered through the Trove API. The `page` metadata generally corresponds to the numbers printed on the original pages. You can search for articles on a specific page using the `firstpageseq` index.

```{admonition} Beware these page peculiarities!
:class: warning

- Newspaper issues sometimes include special supplements with their own internal page numbering. This means, for example, that an issue could contain multiple pages numbered as `1`. You can identify pages in supplements using the `pageSequence` metadata field.
- Some periodicals don't start each issue at page number 1! For example, until 1908 the [Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/698) had continuous page numbering across all issues in a year. So the issue dated 8 September 1894 actually starts with page number `472`. 
```

### Pages are images

The digitisation process creates an image of each newspaper page. These images can be downloaded in different resolutions by [using the page's unique identifier to construct a direct url](download-a-page-image). Articles are extracted from page images by the OCR process.

### Pages are entry points

You can save and share links to pages. These links open the page in the Trove web interface and display a list of included articles. You can also find page links in the `trovePageUrl` field of an article's metadata. However, while you can view pages in the Trove web interface, you can't access information about individual pages using the API – they just don't exist as separate entities.

(newspaper-data-pages-missing)=
### Pages are sometimes missing

Pages that were missing when a newspaper was digitised are usually marked by placeholder images. These missing pages, like other pages, have unique identifiers. You can construct links to them, and even download the placeholder, but they're *not really there*. Because the pages haven't gone through the OCR process, no articles from them will show up in search results. This raises the question, how many newspaper and gazette pages are missing from Trove?


```{figure} /images/missing-page.png
:name: missing-page
:width: 300
Example of a missing page placeholder, from [The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser, 6 January 1894, page 1](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page20232534)
```

(newspaper-page-links)=
## Page links and identifiers

Each newspaper and gazette page has a unique identifier. This identifier pops up in links to pages and PDFs and can be used to download a page image. But where do you find it?

In the web interface look under the 'Cite' tab of an article and you'll see a page identifier of the form `http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page16635065`.

```{figure} /images/article-cite.png
:name: page-cite
:width: 300
Example of a page identifier found in an article's 'Cite' tab.
```

If you click on this link, you get redirected to a different url that looks like this `https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/16635065`. Note that both urls contain the same number – this is the page's numeric identifier.

You can also use the API to get page identifiers from article metadata, but they're not included by default. If you search for articles using the `/result` endpoint, or request a particular article using the `/newspaper` endpoint, you have to set the `reclevel` parameter to `full` to include the page identifiers.

Here's an example of an article record obtained from the API using `reclevel=full`.

```json

    "id": "41697877",
    "url": "https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/41697877",

The identifier of the page on which this article was published is included in the `trovePageUrl` field. But there's also a `pdf` field that contains a list of links that include the same numeric identifier. You can use these links to download PDF copies of pages.

If you're just interested in front pages, there's also a little trick you can use to [get page identifiers from issue urls](get-a-list-of-front-page-urls).

A common task is to get from a web link to an image or PDF. You can do this by extracting the numeric part of the link with a regular expression, then using the number to construct a new url to download the format of your choice.

(newspapers:pages:metadata)=
## Page metadata

+++

Unlike titles and articles, there's no direct method for requesting metadata about a newspaper page from the Trove API. You can't, for example, submit a page identifier to the API and get back its publication date, the newspaper it came from, or a list of articles published on it. Pages are linked to articles and issues, but you can only access those links from the other end – from article and issue records.

As [described above](newspaper-page-links), you can get page identifiers from an article record simply by setting the `reclevel` parameter to `full`. But how can you go in the other direction, and get the identifier for a specific page?

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

(get-page-identifier-from-search)=
### Get the identifier of a specific page by searching for articles

````{margin}
```{seealso}
The [Today's News Yesterday](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#todays-news-yesterday) notebook in the GLAM Workbench provides an example of using `date` and `firstpageseq` to get a particular page.
```
````

To get the identifier of a specific page, you need to construct a very precise search for articles published on that page using the `/result` endpoint. You can do this by specifying the title (the newspaper name), the publication date, and the page number. Once you have the search results, you can extract the page identifier from the article records.

The newspaper title is set using the `l-title` parameter. For example, the identifier for the *Canberra Times* is `11`, so to limit your search to the *Canberra Times* you'd set `l-title` to `11`.

The date is set [using the `date` index](using-the-date-index) within the `q` (query) parameter. You use the `date` index by supplying a date range. If you want a single day, the first date in the range should be the day **before** the date you want. The dates need to be in ISO format – `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z`. For example, if we wanted a page from 2 November 1942, we'd set the `q` parameter to `date:[1942-11-01T00:00:00Z TO 1942-11-02T00:00:00Z]`.

To request a specific page number, [you use the `firstpageseq` index](search-indexes-firstpageseq) in the `q` parameter. To find page 3, you'd add `firstpageseq:3` to the value for `q`.

Finally, you need to add `reclevel=full` to the request. This asks for additional metadata about the article, including the page identifier.

So, in summary, if we wanted the identifier of page 3 of the *Canberra Times* from 2 November 1942, your request would include the following parameters:

- `category=newspaper`
- `l-title=11`
- `q=date:[1942-11-01T00:00:00Z TO 1942-11-02T00:00:00Z] firstpageseq:3`
- `reclevel=full`

[![Try it!](/images/try-trove-api-console.svg)](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/v3/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.trove.nla.gov.au%2Fv3%2Fresult%3Fq%3Ddate%3A%5B1942-11-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+1942-11-02T00%3A00%3A00Z%5D+firstpageseq%3A3%26category%3Dnewspaper%26l-title%3D11%26reclevel%3Dfull%26n%3D1%26encoding%3Djson)

```{warning}
Some newspaper issues include supplements with their own separate page numbering. The `firstpageseq` index searches these supplements as well as the main body of the issue. This means your search could return articles from *multiple* pages. One way of dealing with this is to check the `pageSequence` field of the article, if it includes an 'S' for 'supplement', you can ignore it. There's an example of this in the code below. 
```

The article metadata returned by this search will include a value for `trovePageUrl`, for example: `https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page682904`. You could use this identifier to retrieve an image of the page using the [method described below](download-a-page-image). Here's a full example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
---
import requests

# Search parameters
params = {
    "q": "date:[1942-11-01T00:00:00Z TO 1942-11-02T00:00:00Z] firstPageSeq:3",
    "category": "newspaper",
    "l-title": "11",

}

response = requests.get(

)

# Get the results as JSON
data = response.json()

# As noted, this can return pages in supplements, so we'll try to exclude them
# by looping through the articles until we find one that's not in a supplement
for article in data["category"][0]["records"]["article"]:
    # Make sure there's not an "S" in the pageSequence field by checking if the value is a number
    if article["pageSequence"].isnumeric():
        # It's not in a supplement, so let's get the page id
        page_identifier = article["trovePageUrl"]
        break

    # If all the returned pages are in a supplement then return none
    page_identifier = None

page_identifier
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

(get-a-list-of-front-page-urls)=
### Get a list of front page identifiers

As [described in the section on newspaper issues](issues), you can get information about individual issues from the `newspaper/title` and `gazette/title` endpoints. The issue data includes a `date` and a `url`. But if you request the issue url you're redirected to the first *page* of that issue! This means that you can start with a newspaper, request a list of issues, and then capture the identifiers of all the front pages. Here's a full example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
---
import requests

# To get a list of issues from the newspaper/title endpoint you need to set `include`
# to `years` and provide a date range via `range`.
# Here we're setting range to include all of 1930.
params = {"encoding": "json", "include": "years", "range": "19300101-19301231"}

# Supply API key using headers
headers = {"X-API-KEY": YOUR_API_KEY}

# Here's were requesting details about the Canberra Times (id 11)
url = f"https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/title/11"

# Get the data
response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

# Get the list of years/issues
years = data["year"]

# Let's get issue details for our range
issues = []
for year in years:
    # If the year is in our range it will include an `issue` value
    if "issue" in year:
        # Add this year's issues
        issues += year["issue"]

# We'll use the first 5 values from the list of issues
for issue in issues[:5]:
    # This request is getting a web page, so no params or headers required
    response = requests.get(issue["url"])

    # The request has been redirected to the first page of the issue.
    # We can get the new redirected url from the response object.
    page_url = response.url

    print(f"{issue['date']}: page 1, {page_url}")
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

The number at the end of the page url uniquely identifies that page. It can be used to [download an image of the page](download-a-page-image). While this method is a bit inefficient, forcing us to fire off a request for every issue, it does enable us to link three important pieces of page metadata – the *date*, the *page number*, and the *page identifier*.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### Scraping article metadata from a page

While there's no direct method for requesting information about a page from the API, there is some useful metadata embedded in the HTML of the Trove web site. If you have a page identifier, you can load the web page and extract a list of articles, including their identifiers, categories, titles, and word count. You can even find the positional coordinates of each article on the page.

(newspapers:data:pages:text)=
## Page text

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

To get the full text content of a page, you need to aggregate the content of all the articles published on that page. The method is much the same as that [described above](get-page-identifier-from-search) – you search for articles on a specific page by specifying the newspaper, date and page. You also need to set `include` to `articleText` to add the full text to the article records. You can then collect the text content of each article. Here's an example that collects the article texts from a page and uses them to create a wordcloud using the [WordCloud package](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud).

```{code-cell} ipython3
import requests
from html2text import html2text
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Search parameters
params = {
    "q": "date:[1942-11-01T00:00:00Z TO 1942-11-02T00:00:00Z] firstPageSeq:3",
    "category": "newspaper",
    "l-title": "11",
    "include": "articleText",
    "encoding": "json",
    "n": 100,
}

# Supply API key using headers
headers = {"X-API-KEY": YOUR_API_KEY}

# Make the request
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/result", params=params, headers=headers
)

# Get the results as JSON
data = response.json()

page_text = []

# As noted, this can return pages in supplements, so we'll try to exclude them
for article in data["category"][0]["records"]["article"]:
    # Make sure there's not an "S" in the pageSequence field by checking if the value is a number
    if article["pageSequence"].isnumeric():
        # It's not in a supplement, so let's add the text
        # The full text include HTML tags so we'll strip them out with html2text
        page_text.append(html2text(article["articleText"]))

# Generate a word cloud
wc = WordCloud(width=500, height=300).generate("\n".join(page_text)).to_image()

### Download a page image

````{margin}
```{seealso}
If you want to quickly get a page image from an article url, try the GLAM Workbench's [Download a page image](https://trove-newspaper-apps.uw.r.appspot.com/voila/render/Save-page-image.ipynb) app. 
```
````

Once you know the secret formula, getting page images is easy. You can download a page image using a url like this:

```html
https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page[PAGE ID]/level[ZOOM LEVEL]
```

Where `[PAGE ID]` is the page's numeric identifier, and `[ZOOM LEVEL]` is a number between 1 and 7, corresponding to the zoom levels in the web interface. The higher the zoom level, the larger the image. As a rough guide:

- level `1` gives an image around 900 x 1200 px (500kb)
- level `4` gives an image around 2700 x 3500 px (3mb)
- level `7` gives an image around 6100 x 7800 px (7mb)

For example, this url loads the image for the page with the id `517916`: <https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page517916/level4>

(download-newspaper-page-as-pdf)=
### Download a page as a PDF

If you set the `reclevel` parameter to `full` when requesting articles from the `/result` or `/newspaper` API endpoints, the metadata includes a `pdf` field with a list of urls. These urls can be used to download PDF versions of the page(s) on which the article was published. For example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
---

slideshow:

---
import requests

# Set recelevel to full to include the pdf field
params = {"encoding": "json", "reclevel": "full"}

# Supply API key using headers
headers = {"X-API-KEY": YOUR_API_KEY}

# Use the /newspaper endpoint to request metadata for the article with the id 162833980
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/162833980",
    params=params,
    headers=headers,
)
data = response.json()

# PDF urls can be found in the PDF field
pdfs = data["pdf"]
print(pdfs)
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

From the example above you can see that the article (id `162833980`) was published across two pages:

- [https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page16636766/print](https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page16636766/print)
- [https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page16636767/print](https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page16636767/print)

Once you have the urls you can use them to download the PDFs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
---
import re
from pathlib import Path

for pdf in pdfs:
    # Extract the page identifier to use in the file name

    # Save the PDF using the page_id as a filename
    Path(f"{page_id}.pdf").write_bytes(response.content)
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

If you have a collection of page urls or identifiers (such as [front pages from issues](get-a-list-of-front-page-urls)), you can construct your own urls to download pdfs using the format `https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page[PAGE ID]/print`.
