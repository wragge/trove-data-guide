You can tell if a page is part of a supplement by looking at the confusingly-named `pageSequence` value – it will typically include an 'S' after the page number. There might also be a `pageLabel` value that provides the number printed on the page within the supplement.\n",

    "By using a variation on the method described above, you can even save images of individual words! As explained in [](/newspapers-and-gazettes/how-to/get-ocr-coordinates), the secret is to modify an article's url and set the `searchTerm` parameter to the word you want to save. This will highlight the word wherever it appears in the article. You can then scrape the coordinates of the highlighted words, and crop them from the full page image. This method is used in the GLAM Workbench notebook [Create 'scissors and paste' messages from Trove newspaper articles](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/trove-newspapers-scissors-and-paste/) to generate images like this!\n",
