# Newspapers and copyright

+++



+++

This section will examine both the impact of copyright restrictions on the construction of the Trove newspaper corpus, and the implications of copyright for researchers making use of digitised newspapers.

See [Beyond the copyright cliff of death](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/Beyond_the_copyright_cliff_of_death/) and [Trove newspapers with articles published after 1954](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/csv-newspapers-post-54/)
