This section will attempt some analysis of missing pages and issues in Trove's newspapers. As of 11 August 2023, I'm running a very long harvest of essentially every article in Trove to try and get an idea of what's missing. This will never be precise, but it should at least provide a baseline and point to specific titles and periods that seem to be more affected.

Here's a [quick example using the Canberra Times](https://hcommons.social/@wragge/110845292959103039).

Here's an issue that seems to have a lot of missing pages, but is actually out of order: <https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue2584973>

+++

WA Record, has pages 2 & 3 missing from most issues from 1897 to 1915 (plus others). 5.5% of pages missing. eg <https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/22979867>

Similarly The Clipper (Tas), 2 & 3 missing from most issues between 1906 and 1909. <https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/8820909>

King Island News, p5 missing from 1920s-40s <https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/29646613>

North Queensland Register, blocks of pages missing from multiple issues, 27% of issues have pages missing

Queensland Times has significant damage to original -- missing pages and bad ocr etc will result. eg: https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/13410451

The Critic, Blocks of pages missing regularly, particularly in the 1920s eg: https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/23607088

"809", # Age, some recurring patterns of missing pages

"12", # Courier Mail -- 2 pages missing on Fridays from 1951-55, not many missing elsewhere -- good example of unevenness, 100 pages missing each from 1952-3

Huon Times 667, 3.7% pages missing, pages 3-4 missing in stretches 1914-1917, 1923/4.
