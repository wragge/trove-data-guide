You might think that newspapers are organised in a simple hierarchical structure with titles at the top, and articles at the bottom, but it\u2019s not quite that straighforward. Articles are linked to both pages and titles. Titles have their own API endpoint that can lead you to issues, though following an issue url will actually take you to a page. Pages have identifiers, and you can browse their contents in the Trove web interface, but they don\u2019t exist as separate entities in the API. These sorts of oddities mean that sometimes there\u2019s no direct route to the information that you want, but by thinking about what is connected to what, you can find alternative paths. For example, while there\u2019s no direct link between issues and articles, if you get the publication date and title from an issue, you can then search for articles published in that issue by using the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">date</span></code> index and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">title</span></code> facet.</p><p>This section is organised by <strong>articles</strong>, <strong>pages</strong>, <strong>issues</strong>, and <strong>titles</strong>. For each entity, I\u2019ve described a variety of methods to access metadata, text and images \u2013 some are straightforward, others are a bit hacky, but they work!</p>", "a[href=\"pages.html\"]": "<h1 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">17.2. </span>Accessing data about newspaper &amp; gazette pages<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#accessing-data-about-newspaper-gazette-pages\" title=\"Link to this heading\">#</a></h1><p><img alt=\"Screenshot of the masthead at the top of a newspaper page\" src=\"../../_images/16635065-level4-cropped.jpg\"/></p>", "a[href=\"articles.html\"]": "<h1 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">17.1. </span>Accessing data about newspaper and gazette articles<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#accessing-data-about-newspaper-and-gazette-articles\" title=\"Link to this heading\">#</a></h1><p><img alt=\"Screenshot of Trove web interface displaying basic article metadata\" src=\"../../_images/trove-article-metadata.png\"/></p>"}
