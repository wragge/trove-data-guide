But downloading PDFs using computational methods is not so straightforward. When you click on the buttons in the web interface, you don\u2019t download the PDF from a fixed url. There\u2019s a bit of Javascript code behind the button that asks for for the PDF to be compiled, then alerts the user when it\u2019s ready. To automate the download process, you need to reproduce these steps in your code.
