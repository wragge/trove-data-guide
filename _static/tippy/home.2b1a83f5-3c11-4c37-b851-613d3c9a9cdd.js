Some of those collections are harvested into Trove from collaborating organisations. Other collections, such as the digitised newspapers, are a product of the NLA\u2019s own processing pipelines. Within these groups, resources are linked together in a variety of different ways. For example, a newspaper article is part of an issue, a periodical issue is part of a title, a photograph might be part of an album, a book might be part of a series, and a letter might be part of a manuscript collection. These sorts of relationships can help you navigate through the layers of collections, moving from whole to part and back again.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trove doesn\u2019t have a standard way of representing these sorts of parent/child relationships. Instead, a variety of metadata fields, facets, hierarchical structures, and interfaces group things in inconsistent and sometimes confusing ways. This means that collections are often fragmented in Trove search results, making it hard to see patterns and connections.</p>", "a[href=\"understanding-search/facets.html\"]": "<h1 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">3. </span>Facets<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#facets\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h1><p>Not sure where this belongs\u2026</p><p>Note that categories do not supply a full list of formats.
