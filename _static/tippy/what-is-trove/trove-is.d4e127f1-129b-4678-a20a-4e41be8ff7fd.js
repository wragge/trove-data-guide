The simple question, \u2018What\u2019s in Trove?\u2019, is not easily answered. As I\u2019ve grappled with topics such as Trove\u2019s <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">works and versions</span></a>, and struggled to quantify measures like the <span class=\"xref myst\">number of pages missing from digitised newspapers</span>, I\u2019ve come to realise that Trove, as a whole, is effectively unknowable. It\u2019s too big, too complex, and too inconsistent to yield to precise analysis. It\u2019s also changing constantly, so any attempt to capture its contents will be immediately out of date. The best we can hope for are a series of blurry snapshots that help us understand the characteristics of Trove, even though some of the fine details remain out of focus.</p>", "a[href=\"#id2\"]": "<figure class=\"align-default\" id=\"id2\">\n<a class=\"reference internal image-reference\" href=\"../_images/trove-data-flows-2010-cathro-collier.png\"><img alt=\"../_images/trove-data-flows-2010-cathro-collier.png\" src=\"../_images/trove-data-flows-2010-cathro-collier.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/></a>\n<figcaption>\n<p><span class=\"caption-number\">Fig. 1.1 </span><span class=\"caption-text\">Trove Data Flows, 2010, licensed CC-BY-NC. <span id=\"id1\">[<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../references.html#id21\" title=\"Warwick Cathro and Susan Collier.
