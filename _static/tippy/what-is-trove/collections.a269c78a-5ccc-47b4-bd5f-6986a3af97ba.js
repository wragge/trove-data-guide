This grouping operates on a couple of levels and results in a hierarchical structure where works contain versions, and versions contain the original metadata records. However, it\u2019s <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html#muddy-metadata\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">not always successful</span></a>. As well as obvious grouping errors, works sometimes <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html#not-the-same\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">cram different members of a collection together</span></a>, as if they\u2019re actually the <em>same thing</em>. Even more concerning, it seems that works and versions have sometimes been used deliberately to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html#digitised-works-groups\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">describe collections of digitised resources</span></a>. The problem with this is that the members of these collections are difficult to find and use as their individual metadata has either not been recorded or has been munged together as a single \u2018work\u2019. In effect, <strong>work groupings hide collections</strong>. This is one of the reasons why I recommend unpacking all the versions from works and saving them individually when you\u2019re harvesting data.</p>", "a[href=\"#id2\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">5.8. </span>Digitised collections<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#id2\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2>", "a[href=\"#digitised-collections\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">5.5. </span>Digitised collections<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#digitised-collections\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2>", "a[href=\"#ispartof\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">5.4. </span><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">isPartOf</span></code><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#ispartof\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>Some parent/child relationships in Trove are documented using the Dublin Core <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">isPartOf</span></code> metadata field.

But the categories that contain aggregated content are more complicated, and sometimes confusing.</p><p>The first thing to note is that individual resources can appear in more than one of these categories. For example, if you search for <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/search?keyword=title%3A%22Tasmania%20mineral%20chart%20series%22\">\u201cTasmanian Mineral Chart Series\u201d</a> you\u2019ll be presented with the same set of results in both the <strong>Research &amp; Reports</strong> and <strong>Images, Maps &amp; Artefacts</strong> categories. Why does this happen? The clue is in the formats of the matched resources \u2013 all of them are described both as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Map</span></code> and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Government</span> <span class=\"pre\">publication</span></code>. Unsuprisingly, resources with the format <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Map</span></code> end up in the <strong>Images, Maps &amp; Artefacts</strong> category. But those described as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Government</span> <span class=\"pre\">publication</span></code> are routed to <strong>Research &amp; Reports</strong>.

Some of those collections are harvested into Trove from collaborating organisations. Other collections, such as the digitised newspapers, are a product of the NLA\u2019s own processing pipeline. Within these broad groupings are a range of relationships that link parts together in different ways. For example, a newspaper article is part of an issue, a periodical issue is part of a title, a photograph might be part of an album, a book might be part of a series, and a letter might be part of a manuscript collection. These sorts of relationships help you navigate through the layers of collections, moving from whole to part and back again \u2013 they enable you to see everything in a group, or to focus in on a specific fragment. Unfortunately, Trove doesn\u2019t have a standard way of representing these sorts of parent/child relationships. Instead, a variety of metadata fields, facets, hierarchical structures, and interfaces group things in inconsistent and sometimes confusing ways. This means that Trove search results often appear fragmented and the broader patterns are hard to see.</p>", "a[href=\"works-and-versions.html#muddy-metadata\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">4.2. </span>Muddy metadata<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#muddy-metadata\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>Grouping versions into works promises users cleaner search results, but the reality is more complex and confusing.
