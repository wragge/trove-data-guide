You might think that newspapers are organised in a simple hierarchical structure with titles at the top, and articles at the bottom, but it\u2019s not quite that straighforward.

These sorts of oddities mean that sometimes there\u2019s no direct route to the information that you want, but by thinking about what is connected to what, you can find alternative paths. For example, while there\u2019s no direct link between issues and articles, if you get the publication date and title from an issue, you can then search for articles published in that issue by using the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">date</span></code> index and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">title</span></code> facet.</p><p>This section is organised by <strong>articles</strong>, <strong>pages</strong>, <strong>issues</strong>, and <strong>titles</strong>.

You don\u2019t have to look around too much to find problems with the way Trove\u2019s groupings are implemented.</p><p>This \u2018work\u2019 is titled <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/158465667\">The Wiggles</a> and has 31 \u2018editions\u2019 listed in Trove. The problem is that most of those editions are actually different works, a mix of books, CDs, and DVDs. Presumably the grouping algorithm is connecting them because of the appearance of \u2018The Wiggles\u2019 somewhere in the title, but it\u2019s hard to know for sure as the scoring mechanism isn\u2019t publicly available.</p>", "a[href=\"#use-the-contribcollection-facet-to-filter-searches\"]": "<h3 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><a class=\"toc-backref\" href=\"#id6\" role=\"doc-backlink\">Use the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">contribcollection</span></code> facet to filter searches</a><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#use-the-contribcollection-facet-to-filter-searches\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h3><p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">contribcollection</span></code> facet seems to match all <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">isPartOf</span></code> values, irrespective of their <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">type</span></code>.
