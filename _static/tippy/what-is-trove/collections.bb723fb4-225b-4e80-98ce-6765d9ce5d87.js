Some of those collections are harvested into Trove from collaborating organisations. Other collections, such as the digitised newspapers, are a product of the NLA\u2019s own processing pipeline. Within these broad groupings are a range of relationships that link parts together in different ways. For example, a newspaper article is part of an issue, a periodical issue is part of a title, a photograph might be part of an album, a book might be part of a series, and a letter might be part of a manuscript collection. These sorts of relationships help you navigate through the layers of collections, moving from whole to part and back again \u2013 they enable you to see everything in a group, or to focus in on a specific fragment. Unfortunately, Trove doesn\u2019t have a standard way of representing these sorts of parent/child relationships. Instead, a variety of metadata fields, facets, hierarchical structures, and interfaces group things in inconsistent and sometimes confusing ways. This means that Trove search results often appear fragmented and the broader patterns are hard to see.</p>", "a[href=\"#ispartof\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">5.4. </span><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">isPartOf</span></code><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#ispartof\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>Some parent/child relationships in Trove are documented using the Dublin Core <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">isPartOf</span></code> metadata field.

In the web interface, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">isPartOf</span></code> values can be displayed under a variety of headings, including \u2018Appears in\u2019, \u2018Part of\u2019, and \u2018Series\u2019.

You don\u2019t have to look around too much to find problems with the way Trove\u2019s groupings are implemented.</p><p>This \u2018work\u2019 is titled <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/158465667\">The Wiggles</a> and has 31 \u2018editions\u2019 listed in Trove. The problem is that most of those editions are actually different works, a mix of books, CDs, and DVDs. Presumably the grouping algorithm is connecting them because of the appearance of \u2018The Wiggles\u2019 somewhere in the title, but it\u2019s hard to know for sure as the scoring mechanism isn\u2019t publicly available.</p>", "a[href=\"#works-and-versions\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">5.2. </span>Works and versions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#works-and-versions\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>Trove creates many thousands of little collections by trying to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">group different versions of the same thing together as \u2018works\u2019</span></a>. This grouping operates on a couple of levels and results in a hierarchical structure where works contain versions, and versions contain the original metadata records. However, it\u2019s <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html#muddy-metadata\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">not always successful</span></a>. As well as obvious grouping errors, works sometimes <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html#not-the-same\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">cram different members of a collection together</span></a>, as if they\u2019re actually the <em>same thing</em>. Even more concerning, it seems that works and versions have sometimes been used deliberately to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"works-and-versions.html#digitised-works-groups\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">describe collections of digitised resources</span></a>. The problem with this is that the members of these collections are difficult to find and use as their individual metadata has either not been recorded or has been munged together as a single \u2018work\u2019. In effect, <strong>work groupings hide collections</strong>. This is one of the reasons why I recommend unpacking all the versions from works and saving them individually when you\u2019re harvesting data.</p>", "a[href=\"works-and-versions.html#not-the-same\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">4.3. </span>Not the same<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#not-the-same\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>The challenges are magnified when working with resources that don\u2019t come from standard library systems.
