The available resolutions vary across categories and formats, and you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll get until you download it.

You might think that newspapers are organised in a simple hierarchical structure with titles at the top, and articles at the bottom, but it\u2019s not quite that straighforward. Articles are linked to both pages and titles. Titles have their own API endpoint that can lead you to issues, though following an issue url will actually take you to a page. Pages have identifiers, and you can browse their contents in the Trove web interface, but they don\u2019t exist as separate entities in the API. These sorts of oddities mean that sometimes there\u2019s no direct route to the information that you want, but by thinking about what is connected to what, you can find alternative paths. For example, while there\u2019s no direct link between issues and articles, if you get the publication date and title from an issue, you can then search for articles published in that issue by using the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">date</span></code> index and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">title</span></code> facet.</p><p>This section is organised by <strong>articles</strong>, <strong>pages</strong>, <strong>issues</strong>, and <strong>titles</strong>. For each entity, I\u2019ve described a variety of methods to access metadata, text and images \u2013 some are straightforward, others are a bit hacky, but they work!</p>", "a[href=\"accessing-data/using-web-interface.html\"]": "<h1 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">13. </span>Downloading data from the Trove web interface<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#downloading-data-from-the-trove-web-interface\" title=\"Link to this heading\">#</a></h1><h2><span class=\"section-number\">13.1. </span>Downloading images, PDFs, text, and audio<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#downloading-images-pdfs-text-and-audio\" title=\"Link to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>Items that have been digitised by the NLA and made available through one of Trove\u2019s digitised item viewers can usually be downloaded in a variety of formats.

While there are regular updates on newly-added titles, there\u2019s no way of seeing when particular titles were added or the change in the number of articles over time. Earlier versions of Trove included a page of useful statistics, but this was removed in the 2020 update. To explore how Trove has changed over time, you need to piece together different data sources.</p><p>I started analysing Trove searches back in 2011, and continued at irregular intervals to create charts showing the number of articles per year in Trove. I\u2019ve extracted the data from these charts and compiled it into a dataset available from <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6471544\">Zenodo</a> and <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals-historical\">GitHub</a>.
