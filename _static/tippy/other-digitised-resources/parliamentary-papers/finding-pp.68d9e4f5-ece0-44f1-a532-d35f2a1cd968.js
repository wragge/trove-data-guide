Instead of having to wade through a long list of near-identical entries, a user can quickly focus in on a title of interest, and drill down to find a specific version at a specific library. This idea is based on the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.ifla.org/references/best-practice-for-national-bibliographic-agencies-in-a-digital-age/resource-description-and-standards/bibliographic-control/functional-requirements-the-frbr-family-of-models/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records-frbr/\">Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records</a> (FRBR).

Some of those collections are harvested into Trove from collaborating organisations. Other collections, such as the digitised newspapers, are a product of the NLA\u2019s own processing pipelines. Within these groups, resources are linked together in a variety of different ways. For example, a newspaper article is part of an issue, a periodical issue is part of a title, a photograph might be part of an album, a book might be part of a series, and a letter might be part of a manuscript collection. These sorts of relationships can help you navigate through the layers of collections, moving from whole to part and back again.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trove doesn\u2019t have a standard way of representing these sorts of parent/child relationships. Instead, a variety of metadata fields, facets, hierarchical structures, and interfaces group things in inconsistent and sometimes confusing ways.
