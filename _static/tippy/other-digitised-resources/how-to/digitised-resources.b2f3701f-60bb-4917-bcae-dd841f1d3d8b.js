The major problem is that digitised resources are often assembled into groups or collections, and the full details of these groupings are not available through the Trove API. This means that simply harvesting results from an API query will miss many digitised resources. In addition, the way resources are described and arranged is often inconsistent, so you can\u2019t assume that a particular type of resource will be grouped in a particular way.</p><p>As a result of these problems, a \u2018belts and braces\u2019 approach seems best \u2013 follow every possible route and harvest as many records as possible. This may result in duplicates, but these can be dealt with later. In any case, Trove already contains a large number of duplicate records for digitised resources, so some form of merging or de-duplication will always be required.</p>", "a[href=\"extract-embedded-metadata.html\"]": "<h1 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">21.3. </span>HOW TO: Extract additional metadata from the web page of a digitised work<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#how-to-extract-additional-metadata-from-the-web-page-of-a-digitised-work\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h1><p>The viewers you use to examine digitised resources in Trove embed some metadata that isn\u2019t available through the Trove API. This includes a JSON-ified version of the item\u2019s MARC record (presumably copied from the NLA catalogue), as well as structural information used by the viewer itself, such as a list of pages in a digitised book.</p><p>This metadata can be useful in a number of different contexts. For example, you can extract the number of pages in a digitised book, then use this number to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"download-items-text-images.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">automatically download the full text or a PDF</span></a>.

In the web interface, collections will have a \u2018Browse this collection\u2019 link or button that displays a list of the contents, but getting machine-readable data is not so straightforward.
