The major problem is that digitised resources are often assembled into groups or collections, and the full details of these groupings are not available through the Trove API. This means that simply harvesting results from an API query will miss many digitised resources. In addition, the way resources are described and arranged is often inconsistent, so you can\u2019t assume that a particular type of resource will be grouped in a particular way.</p><p>As a result of these problems, a \u2018belts and braces\u2019 approach seems best \u2013 follow every possible route and harvest as many records as possible. This may result in duplicates, but these can be dealt with later. In any case, Trove already contains a large number of duplicate records for digitised resources, so some form of merging or de-duplication will always be required.</p>", "a[href=\"extract-embedded-metadata.html\"]": "<h1 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\"><span class=\"section-number\">24.3. </span>HOW TO: Extract additional metadata from the digitised resource viewer<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#how-to-extract-additional-metadata-from-the-digitised-resource-viewer\" title=\"Link to this heading\">#</a></h1><p>The viewers you use to examine digitised resources in Trove embed some metadata that isn\u2019t available through the Trove API.
