    "## Identifying identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "As you navigate around Trove you'll find a range of url patterns pointing to different types of resources. Some examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/61389505`\n",
    "- `http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page5417618`\n",
    "- `https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/1144040`\n",
    "- `http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-title246`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these urls are 'identifiers', maintained by the NLA as persistent links to resources. These identifiers are independent of the platform used to deliver content, so should persist across site redesigns and technology upgrades. This built-in persistence is why identifiers are recommended for use in citations. When you 'resolve' a persistent identifier by plugging it into your web browser you often end up at a different url. This is because the identifier redirects you to the appropriate page in the current site structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Use the cite tab Luke!\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to save a link it's tempting just to copy the url in your browser's address bar, but it's better to use the persistent identifier if one is available. Most of the time you can find the persistent identifier by clicking on the **Cite** tab in the Trove web interface. If you're using the API (since version 3), persistent identifiers will be automatically included in results.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NLA identifiers generally start with `https://nla.gov.au/nla.`. For example, a newspaper article identifier looks like this: `http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61389505`. Notice that this identifier includes a numeric id as well as information about the type of thing this is – `news-article`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identifiers used for other digitised resources have a more generic form, starting with `http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj`. Digitised books, individual pages in a book, photos, periodicals, periodical issues, finding aids all share the same basic pattern. You can't tell by looking at one of these identifiers what it actually points to – you have to follow it and find out! \n",
    "\n",
    "Not everything in Trove has a persistent identifier. Works, for example, only have a url of the form `https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/1144040`. This identifies a work within the context of Trove, but there's no guarantee of persistence. Work records are aggregated from a range of sources, and can be withdrawn or deleted by the contributing organisation. \n",

    "Some identifiers lead outside of Trove to other NLA systems such as Libraries Australia and the main catalogue."
