    "## A collection of collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Trove is a collection of collections. Some of those collections are harvested into Trove from collaborating organisations. Other collections, such as the digitised newspapers, are a product of the NLA's own processing pipelines. Within these groups, resources are linked together in a variety of different ways. For example, a newspaper article is part of an issue, a periodical issue is part of a title, a photograph might be part of an album, a book might be part of a series, and a letter might be part of a manuscript collection. These sorts of relationships can help you navigate through the layers of collections, moving from whole to part and back again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Trove doesn't have a standard way of representing these sorts of parent/child relationships. Instead, a variety of metadata fields, facets, hierarchical structures, and interfaces group things in inconsistent and sometimes confusing ways. This means that collections are often fragmented in Trove search results, making it hard to see patterns and connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trove's categories are not collections!\n",
    "\n",
    "Trove's top-level categories *look* like collections, but beware! While some categories, like **Newspapers & Gazettes**, have clear cut boundaries, others don't. As I've suggested in the [section on categories and zones](contexts-not-collections), it's best to think of the categories as contexts for discovery rather than collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Works and versions can hide collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Trove creates many thousands of little collections by trying to [group different versions of the same thing together as 'works'](/what-is-trove/works-and-versions.md). This grouping operates on a couple of levels and results in a hierarchical structure where works contain versions, and versions contain the original metadata records. However, it's [not always successful](muddy-metadata). As well as obvious grouping errors, works sometimes [cram different members of a collection together](not-the-same), as if they're actually the *same thing*. Even more concerning, it seems that works and versions have sometimes been used deliberately to [describe collections of digitised resources](digitised-works-groups). The problem with this is that the members of these collections are difficult to find and use as their individual metadata has either not been recorded or has been munged together as a single 'work'. In effect, **work groupings hide collections**. This is one of the reasons why I recommend unpacking all the versions from works and saving them individually when you're harvesting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding collections by contributor\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore the different collections harvested into Trove by filtering your search results according to the source of the metadata. Organisations contributing data to Trove are assigned a National Union Catalogue (NUC) identifier. You can find an organisation's NUC by searching the [Australian Libraries Gateway](http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/libraries/index.html), or by looking in the dropdown list of 'Organisations' in Trove's advanced search form (the NUC is in square brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /images/nuc-dropdown.png\n",
    ":name: \"nuc-dropdown\"\n",
    ":width: 600px\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Advanced search for NUCs is broken!\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "While you can use Trove's advanced search to *find* a NUC, you can't reliably use it to search for items using that NUC. There's a longstanding bug that means if you select an organisation whose NUC includes a colon you'll get **no results**. You can fix the broken url by simply putting double quotes around the NUC value, or use one of the methods below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a NUC you can find records from that organisation by using either the `nuc:` index or the `partnerNuc` facet – as far as I can tell the results are the same. For example, to find records from the ANU's institutional repository you'd [search for `nuc:\"ANU:IR\"`](https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/research?keyword=nuc%3A%22ANU%3AIR%22) (note the double quotes around the NUC value).\n",

    "## `isPartOf` relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parent/child relationships in Trove are documented using the Dublin Core `isPartOf` metadata field. This field can appear in records aggregated into Trove from other organisations, as well as in records of digitised resources created by the NLA itself. In the web interface, `isPartOf` values can be displayed under a variety of headings, including 'Appears in', 'Part of', and 'Series'.

    "The value of `isPartOf` is a text string rather than an identifier, so the connections can be a bit fuzzy. Also, a record can have multiple `isPartOf` values linking it to different points in a collection hierarchy – a record might be linked both to its direct parent and the top-level collection record. This means you can't reliably reconstruct a collection from the `isPartOf` values alone. Nonetheless, they can be useful in finding groupings of related resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the API example above, `isPartOf` values can be qualified by supplying a `type`. The most common types seem to be `series` and `publication`. The [Trove Data Dictionary](https://trove.nla.gov.au/partners/partner-services/contribute/trove-data-dictionary) doesn't explain how the `type` qualifiers are meant to be used, but it seems that `series` generally denotes a collection, while `publication` is a more restricted grouping, such as the title of a parent publication.\n",

However, **the matches must be exact, and are case-sensitive** – searching by `Annual report`, `Annual Report` and `Annual report.` will all produce different results! For example, to find more oral histories from the 'Australian women scientists oral history project' you could add `l-contribcollection=Australian women scientists oral history project.` to your query, but it only returns two results.\n",
