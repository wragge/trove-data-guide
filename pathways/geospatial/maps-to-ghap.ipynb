    "## Finding digitised maps in Trove\n",
    "\n",
    "To find digitised maps in Trove you can use a variation of [my standard hack](/understanding-search/finding-digitised-content.md), searching for `\"nla.obj\"` in the 'Image' category, and then setting 'Type' to `Maps`, 'Format' to `Map`, and 'Access' to `Online`. This search currently [returns more that 40,000 results](https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/images?keyword=%22nla.obj%22&l-artType=Maps&l-format=Map&l-availability=y). \n",

    "But of course the important thing about maps is that they relate to a particular *place*. How do you find digitised maps in Trove by their location? Trove provides a very broad 'Place' facet which lets you filter by state or country, but this is based on text values in the `spatial` field of the metadata, not on their actual coordinates. The NLA's [Mapsearch interface](https://mapsearch.nla.gov.au/) (which is strangely hidden away) does let you search by spatial coordinates, but it returns less than half the digitised maps [I've found with coordinates in their metadata](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/single-maps-coordinates-data/) and doesn't let you download a list of results. My own [cluster map of digitised map locations](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/trove-map-clusters.html) is fun to explore, but doesn't help you create a dataset for further analysis or annotation.\n",

The [first dataset](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/single-maps-data/) contains data describing digitised maps, [harvested](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/exploring-digitised-maps/) from the Trove API and enriched with metadata embedded in the digitised map viewer. This enriched metadata sometimes includes a text string containing spatial information – either the maps centre point, or a bounding box.\n",

    "\"l-format\": \"Map/Single map\"\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the format facet was set to `Map/Single map`, rather than the broader `Map`. This was to avoid complications with map series which Trove sometimes groups as versions of a single work. But it does mean that a significant amount of maps could be missing from the dataset. A future version will try to work around this issue and include more maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [second dataset](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/single-maps-coordinates-data/) is the result of an attempt to [parse the spatial metadata](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/parse-coordinates/) as geospatial coordinates. Of the 34,844 maps in the initial dataset, 28,205 had usable spatial metadata. For example, the string \n",

    "`(E 130⁰50'--E 131⁰00'/S 12⁰30'--S 12⁰40')` \n",
    "\n",

    "| North | -12.500000 |\n",
    "| South | -12.666667 |\n",

    "|------|-------|\n",
    "| Latitude | -12.5833  |\n",
    "| Longitude | 130.9167 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial metadata includes a significant number of errors and inconsistencies. The parsing process excluded values that were obviously wrong, such as latitudes greater than 90, and changed a small number where latitudes or longitudes had the wrong sign. But other errors remain. Don't be surprised if maps pop up in unexpected locations. The spatial metadata provides a useful way of exploring and aggregating the digitised maps, but you shouldn't assume that it is always accurate."

    "## Creating a subset of digitised maps by searching for coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, 28,205 maps in the harvested dataset have usable spatial coordinates. The GLAM Workbench notebook [Create a subset of digitised maps by searching for coordinates](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/create-map-subsets/) uses this data to create a GeoDataFrame that you can query using another set of coordinates. For example, if you query the GeoDataFrame with a bounding box it will return details of all the maps whose centre points fall within the coordinates of that bounding box. In other words, you can find maps by their location.\n",
