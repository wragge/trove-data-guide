## Creating datasets

These tools and examples can help you create your own collections of collection and system from Trove.

### GLAM Workbench notebooks

[Gathering historical data about the addition of newspaper titles to Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/historical-data-newspaper-titles/)
: The number of digitised newspapers available through Trove has increased dramatically since 2009. Understanding when newspapers were added is important for historiographical purposes, but there's no data about this available directly from Trove. This notebook uses web archives to extract lists of newspapers in Trove over time, and chart Trove's development.

[Harvest information about newspaper issues](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/harvest_newspaper_issues/)
: When you search Trove's newspapers, you find articles â€“ these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? On what dates were newspapers published? This notebook shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.

[Get the page coordinates of a digitised newspaper article from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/trove-newspapers-get-coordinates-of-articles/)
: This notebook demonstrates how to find the coordinates of a newspaper article on a digitised page.

[Harvest details of Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers digitised in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-government/harvest-parliamentary-papers/)
: Trove includes thousands of digitised papers and reports presented to the Commonwealth Parliament. However, finding all the Parliamentary Papers is not straightforward because of inconsistencies in the way they've been arranged and described. This notebook attempts to work around these problems and harvest as complete as possible data about Parliamentary Papers in Trove.

[Get details of periodicals from the /magazine/titles API endpoint](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/periodicals-from-api/)
: This notebook uses the /magazine/titles endpoint of the Trove API to get details of digitised periodical titles and issues. It then tries to fix some problems with the data by removing duplicates and Parliamentary Papers, and checking the lists of issues against those scraped from the Trove website.

[Enrich the list of periodicals from the Trove API](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/periodicals-enrich-for-datasette/)
: This notebook tries to fix some problems with the periodicals data from the Trove API. It also enriches the harvested data by extracting additional information from the website. It creates two datasets â€“ one for titles and one for issues â€“ and loads these into an SQLite database for use with Datasette Lite.

[Harvest details of periodicals submitted to Trove through the National edeposit scheme (NED)](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/harvest-ned-periodicals/)
: This notebook harvests details of periodicals submitted to Trove through the National edeposit scheme (NED). It creates two datasets, one containing details of the periodical titles, and the other listing all the available issues.

[Harvest summary data from Trove lists](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/harvest-summary-data-from-lists/)
: Use the Trove API to harvest data about all public lists, then extract some summary data and explore a few different techniques to analyse the complete dataset.

[Harvest public tags from Trove zones](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/harvest-tags/)
: This notebook harvests all the public tags that users have added to records in Trove. However, tags are being added all the time, so by the time you've finished harvesting, the dataset will probably be out of date.

[Harvest oral histories metadata](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/harvest-oral-histories/)
: Harvests metadata describing the NLA's oral history collection from Trove and saves the results as a CSV file.

[Save a list of oral history collections and projects](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/save-series/)
: Extracts a list of series from metadata describing oral histories held by the NLA and described in Trove.

[Harvest ABC Radio National records from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/harvest-abcrn/)
: Trove harvests details of programs and segments broadcast on ABC Radio National. You can find them by searching for nuc:"ABC:RN" in the Music & Audio category. The records include basic metadata such as titles, dates, and contributors, but not full transcripts or audio. This notebook harvests, cleans, and saves all the available Radio National data from Trove.

[Create title datasets from collections and subjects](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-web-archives/create-datasets/)
: This notebook helps you create a dataset of archived urls using Pandora's subject and collection groupings.

[Harvest Pandora subjects and collections](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-web-archives/harvest-pandora-subject-collections/)
: This notebook harvests Pandora's navigation hierarchy, saving the connections between subjects, collections, and titles.

[Harvest the full collection of Pandora titles](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-web-archives/harvest-pandora-titles/)
: This notebook harvests a complete collection of archived web page titles from Pandora, the National Library of Australia's selective web archive.

[Find urls of digitised finding aids](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/find-finding-aids/)
: This notebook uses the Trove API to harvest urls of NLA digitised finding aids from a search in the collection zone.

[Collect information about digitised finding aids](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/get-info-finding-aids/)
: This notebook works through a list of urls pointing to NLA's digitised finding aids, extracting additional information about each one.

### Software packages

[trove-newspaper-harvester](https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-harvester/)
: The Trove Newspaper (& Gazette) Harvester makes it easy to download large quantities of digitised articles from Troveâ€™s newspapers and gazettes. Just give it a search from the Trove web interface, and the harvester will save the metadata of all the articles in a CSV (spreadsheet) file for further analysis. You can also save the full text of every article, as well as copies of the articles as JPG images, and even PDFs.
