See Trove's [Using the API](https://trove.nla.gov.au/about/create-something/using-api) help page for full details, but in summary you need to:\n",

    "## Constructing your search\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is constructing a search that will return relevant newspaper articles. This is harder than it seems. Yes, you can just plug keywords into Trove's search interface and get back interesting looking results. But it's important to keep in mind the differing needs of *discovery* versus *analysis*. Your aim here is not to find a few useful articles, but to construct a dataset containing *all* the articles returned by your search query. **Everything.** When you're searching for individual articles you can usually just ignore the fact that there are millions of articles in your search results, as Trove's relevance ranking pushes the most likely candidates to the top. But if you're creating a dataset, you want to be as precise as possible to avoid including unwanted noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Relevance in bulk harvests\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "Unlike the web interface, when you harvest newspaper articles from the Trove API they're ordered by their identifier, not their relevance. So you can't just get the first few hundred articles and assume you've got the most important stuff. However, the API results do include a relevance score that you can use to filter the dataset *after* you've finished harvesting. This is discussed further below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways of making your search more precise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [de-fuzzify your results](search:simple:defuzzify) by controlling the precision of text searches\n",
    "- use [proximity searches](search:simple:proximity) to specify the distance between search terms\n",
    "- [apply facets](search:simple:facets) to limit your results – in particular you might want to use:\n",
    "  - **Type** to include newspapers (or gazettes) only\n",
    "  - **Category** to specify the type of articles (do you really want to include advertisements?)\n",
    "  - **Place** to specify the state in which articles were published\n",
    "  - **Word Count** to limit to articles of a particular length\n",
    "  - **Date range** to specify the date span (do you really want everything from 1803 to 2020?)\n",
    " \n",

    "The Trove Newspaper & Gazette Harvester saves metadata and content from all the newspaper articles in a set of search results. You could easily end up with a dataset containing thousands (or even millions) of articles published across two centuries of Australian history. This opens up possibilities for fine-grained analysis, tracking language, events, and publication patterns back to a specific article in a specific newspaper issue. But you might also want to observe changes at a larger scale, comparing years, decades, or newspapers rather than individual articles. Some text analysis tools also work best with aggregated collections, or corpora, rather than thousands of tiny text files. As a result, you might want to reshape your harvested dataset, creating subsets of articles for analysis.\n",
