This notebook analyses the language of a sample of articles from each newspaper to create a list of non-English newspapers.\n",

    ": In this notebook we use TextBlob to extract nouns, verbs, and sentences from the OCRd text of a 19th century cookery book. We try to clean things up a bit, using regular expressions to discard likely OCR errors. Then we recombine the various parts in random combinations to create delicious recipes for all occasions.
