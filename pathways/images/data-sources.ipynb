    "[Get covers (or any other pages) from a digitised journal in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/get-covers-from-digitised-journal/)\n",
    ": This notebook shows how to download all the cover images from a specified periodical. With some minor modifications you could download any page, or range of pages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Harvest illustrations from periodicals](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/harvest-illustrations-from-periodicals/)\n",
    ": This notebook shows you how to harvest illustrations from Trove's digitised periodicals. It makes use of layout information generated by Trove's OCR processing to find the coordinates of illustrations on a digitised page. Using these coordinates the illustrations can be cropped from the page image and saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Save a Trove newspaper article as an image](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/Save-Trove-newspaper-article-as-image/)\n",
    ": This notebook grabs the page on which an article was published, and then crops the page image to the boundaries of the article. The result is a complete, intact image which presents the article as it was originally published. And if the article is split across multiple pages, you'll get one image per page.\n",

    "[Harvest Australian Women's Weekly covers (or the front pages of any newspaper)](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/harvest-aww-covers-and-newspaper-front-pages/)\n",
    ": Somewhat confusingly, the Australian Women's Weekly is in with Trove's digitised newspapers and not the rest of the magazines. There are notebooks in the GLAM Workbench's journals section to help harvest all of a journal's covers as images, so I thought I should do the same for the Weekly. This notebook can be easily adjusted to download the front pages of any digitised newspaper.\n",

    "[Download a collection of digitised images](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/download-image-collection/)\n",
    ": Digitised photographs and other images are often organised into collections. While the Trove web interface does include a download option for collections, it has a number of limitations. This notebook provides an alternative method that downloads all of the available images in a collection (and any sub-collections) at the highest available resolution.\n",

It’s intended for integration into other tools and processing workflows, or for people who like working on the command line.\n",

    ": The Trove Newspaper (& Gazette) Harvester makes it easy to download large quantities of digitised articles from Trove’s newspapers and gazettes. Just give it a search from the Trove web interface, and the harvester will save the metadata of all the articles in a CSV (spreadsheet) file for further analysis. You can also save the full text of every article, as well as copies of the articles as JPG images, and even PDFs.\n",
