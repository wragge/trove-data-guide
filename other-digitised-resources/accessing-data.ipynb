Once you have the identifier, it's just a matter of adding the appropriate suffix to construct a url that leads directly to the image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suffixes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-t`: leads to a thumbnail version of the image (usually around 123px wide)\n",
    "- `/image`: leads to a higher-resolution JPEG version of the image (longest dimension is a maximum of 5000px)\n",
    "- `/representativeImage`: leads to an image which has been selected to represent a collection\n",
    "- `/m`: leads to a very high-resolution TIFF version of the image (only available for selected resources, mostly maps)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional parameters you can use with `/image` and `/representativeImage`, though I'm not sure how reliably they work:\n",

    "- `wid`: desired width in pixels\n",
    "- `hei`: desired height in pixels\n",

    ":class: note\n",
    "The sizes of images downloaded using the `/image` suffix vary unpredictably. Sizes seem to range up to a maximum of 5000 pixels along the longest dimension, but some are much smaller, including many digitised photographs. However, images obtained this way are at the same, or higher, resolution than those available through Trove's built-in download option.\n",
