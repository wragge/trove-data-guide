    "# HOW TO: Get text, images, and PDFs using Trove's download link\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download text, images, and PDFs from individual digitised items using the Trove web interface. But only the text of periodical articles is available for machine access through the Trove API. This makes it difficult to assemble datasets, or build processing pipelines involving digitised resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page documents a workaround developed by reverse-engineering the download link used by the Trove web interface. You can use it to automate the download of text, images, and PDFs from many digitised resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Trove's download link\n",
    "\n",
    "Trove's digitised object viewers include a 'Download' tab that provides options for downloading the current item.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../../images/download-button.png\n",
    ":name: download-button\n",
    ":width: 500px\n",
    "\n",
    "Download options for a digitised book\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click on the **Start download** button, your browser actually fires off a request to Trove that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-33685055/download?downloadOption=ocr&firstPage=0&lastPage=101`\n",
    "\n",
    "The url contains a few key parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-[ID]/download?downloadOption=[FORMAT]&firstPage=[FIRST]&lastPage=[LAST]`\n",
    "\n",
    "| parameter | description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `[ID]` | the NLA identifier for the current item or collection, for example `nla.obj-3199043190`\n",
    "| `downloadOption` | the desired format of the download, it can be one of `ocr`, `pdf`, `zip`, or `tif` (the available options depend on the type of resource)\n",
    "| `firstPage` and `lastPage` | numbers that define the range of items you want to download â€“ ranges start at `0`, so if a book had fifty pages you'd set `firstPage` to `0` and `lastPage` to `49`|\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that 'pages' in this context actually refers to the number of images in the digitised version, rather than the number of printed pages in the original work. This is because the digitised version will typically include images of book covers and endpapers as well as printed pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DIY download links\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "This method is used in a number of GLAM Workbench notebooks to download the OCRd text of books and periodicals. See, for example, [Harvesting the text of digitised books (and ephemera)](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/harvesting-text-of-digitised-books/) and [Get OCRd text from a digitised journal in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/get-ocrd-text-from-digitised-journal/).\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand the structure of the download urls, you can create your own without using the web interface. All you need to know is a resource's NLA identifier and the number of pages/images it contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [The gold finder of Australia : how he went, how he fared, how he made his fortune](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-248742150) is a pamphlet published in 1853. It's NLA identifier is `nla.obj-248742150` and it has `80` pages. To download all of the OCRd text from this book, you'd insert the identifier and set `lastPage` to `79` (`80` minus `1`):\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-248742150/download?downloadOption=ocr&firstPage=0&lastPage=79>\n",
    "\n",
    "Or perhaps you'd like the whole pamphlet as a PDF? Just change `downloadOption` from `ocr` to `pdf`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-248742150/download?downloadOption=pdf&firstPage=0&lastPage=79>\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Zip files can be big!\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting `downloadOption` to `zip` you can download all the digitised images that make up a resource in a single zip file. But beware! Pages of digitised books or journals can weigh in at a few megabytes each, so zipping them all together can create one, very large file. *The gold finder of Australia* only has 80 pages, but a zip file containing every page ends up at 282mb! If you want to download all the images from a collection of resources, it's probably best to take a more patient approach and download each image individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download selected pages\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "The GLAM Workbench notebook [Get covers (or any other pages) from a digitised journal in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/get-covers-from-digitised-journal/) uses this method to download the cover from every issue of a  digitised periodical.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to ask for everything at once. By adjusting the `firstPage` and `lastPage` values, you can download a specific range of pages. If you wanted the first ten pages of *The gold finder of Australia* as zipped images, you'd set `firstPage` to `0` and `lastPage` to `9`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-248742150/download?downloadOption=zip&firstPage=0&lastPage=9>\n",
    "\n",
    "To request a single page, set `firstPage` and `lastPage` to the same value. For example, if you wanted an image of the cover, you'd set both `firstPage` and `lastPage` to `0`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-248742150/download?downloadOption=zip&firstPage=0&lastPage=0>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do you know the number of pages?\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of this method lies in the fact that it can be used programatically to download large collections of digitised items without any manual intervention. But to do that you need some way of finding out the number of pages or images in each item so you can set the `lastPage` value. This information isn't included in the metadata from the API, and so requires a little extra effort to extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach varies depending on the type of resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're downloading a resource that is made up of pages, such as a book or periodical, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [extract the metadata](digitised:howto:embedded:extract-metadata) embedded in the digitised book or journal viewer\n",
    "- [get the length of the `page` array](digitised:howto:embedded:pages) from the metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're downloading a collection of images, manuscripts, or maps, you can look for the value of `maxNumOfChildDownloads` embedded in the HTML of the digitised image viewer. Here's an example that finds the number of photographs in the collection of [B.A.N.Z. Antarctic Research Expedition photographs](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-141170265) (nla.obj-141170265).\n"
