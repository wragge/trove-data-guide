    "# Digital object identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexities of Trove's digital object identifer scheme are introduced in [](/what-is-trove/links-and-identifiers). The main issue confronting users is that identifiers for different types of digital objects – such as books, pages, issues, articles, photographs, and collections – all look the same. This is important because the digital identifier provides a key to unlock an object's metadata and digital representations. **To access data about digitised resources in Trove you need to understand how the identifiers work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recognising digital object identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital object identifiers are a url with the form: `https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-[NUMBER]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: <http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-141171021> identifies a photograph of two angry rockhopper penguins. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual identifier part is the `nla.obj-141171021`. The `nla.obj` tells you identifier scheme being using, and `141171021` points to an object uniquely identified within this scheme. Sometimes when I talk about identifiers I mean the `nla.obj-141171021` part rather than the whole url.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where do the urls go?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you plug a digital object identifier into your browser you're taken to one of Trove's digital object viewers.\n",
