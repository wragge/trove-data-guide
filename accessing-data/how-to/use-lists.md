The GLAM Workbench notebook [Convert a Trove list into a CSV file](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/convert-a-trove-list-into-a-csv-file/) shows you how to save the full details of newspaper articles in a Trove list as a CSV file. You can also save the articles as PDFs and images, and download the OCRd text.
```
````
Another option for creating collections of manually selected newspaper article metadata is Trove's built-in Lists function.

See the [Trove Lists](/user-generated-data/trove-lists) section for information on saving lists metadata.
